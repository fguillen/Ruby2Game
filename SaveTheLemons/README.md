# Save the Lemons

Simple game made with [Ruby in Fantasy](https://github.com/fguillen/fantasy).

The lemons are trying to cross the river. Help them to not fall into the cold water. You manage the little lifeboat, be sure that as many as possible lemons finish the journey.

Strongly inspired in [Lemons by C. R. Dewhurst](http://bbcmicro.co.uk//jsbeeb/play.php?autoboot&disc=http://bbcmicro.co.uk//gameimg/discs/1825/Disc102-Lemons.ssd&noseek)

## Instructions

Use cursor keys left and right to manage the lifeboat. You get points when a lemon bounce
on your lifeboat. And extra points if the lemon riches the other side safely.

If more than 25 lemons drown into the cold water you lose the game.

But watch out!. Someone is throwing arrows into the water; if one arrives on your lifeboat
it will burst!. There are also mystery ketchup bottles which if they reach the other side,
will reward you.

## How to run
